# Fox and Rabbit Life Simulation 🦊🐇

**Academic Project – University Python Course**  

This project is a **simulation of a simple ecosystem** with foxes and rabbits. It was developed as part of a university course to explore **agent-based modeling**, **simulation techniques**, and **Python programming**.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Model the population dynamics of rabbits and foxes in a simplified ecosystem.  
- Implement rules for **movement, reproduction, and predation**.  
- Analyze how populations evolve over time under different initial conditions.  
- Apply object-oriented programming principles for modularity and clarity.  

---

## 🛠 Technologies & Tools

- **Python 3.11**  
- Standard Python modules: `random`, `time`, `matplotlib` (optional for visualization)  
- IDE used: PyCharm (development)

## 📝 Features

- **Population simulation** of rabbits and foxes.  
- Each species has rules for movement, reproduction, and survival.  
- Simulation can run for a defined number of steps or until extinction of a species.  
- Optional visualization of population dynamics over time.  
- Modular code structure for easy modifications or extensions.
